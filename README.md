#Lag
1.  Run ScpToolkit Settings Manager
2.  Use asynchronoous HID Report Processing
3.  Disable Rumble and Native Feed

#Compile
1.  SlimDx SDK installed - https://slimdx.org/
2.  SCPToolkit driver installed

#Could be better
1.  Problems translating mouse movement into the right stick directional look.  Very challenging to make it a smooth experience.  
    - Was altered from the original to be smoother but still a 50/50 experience.
2.  Live preview improvements (Nicer gui?)

#Todo
1.  Check if SlimDX and SCP driver are installed and if not throw an understandable error.
2.  Work on smoothing mouse translation/normalization
3.  Mouse input buttons dont work as of yet.
4.  Scroll Wheel movement has not been added (Main usage maybe RTS).
5.  There is no help text options yet.
6.  You cant use the keyboard for triggers... Yet
7.  Add Jenkins job to compile merges
